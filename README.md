# Simple Parser written in C

This is a little project to learn how parsing and the clang works. This code is mostly based on the [interpreter book](https://interpreterbook.com/) by Thorsten Ball, but exept the ideas and concepts (which are all "stolen") this code is complete garbage so have fun reading it. :)
